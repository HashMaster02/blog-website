If you’ve read my last blog post, “Overcome Learner’s Block”, and have decided to learn a new skill or pick up a new hobby, then congratulations, you’re already on your way to a more fun and interesting life. However, there are certain things you need to understand about the process of learning in order to ensure you don’t quit too soon. These are things I’ve noticed myself over the years of learning new skills and seeing others do the same.

# **Status: Beginner**

I’d like to explain this one with a personal example. When I first started learning 3D modelling in Blender, I found myself sifting through many pieces of artwork on platforms such as Instagram and Artstation. I loved how detailed all the models were, the textures, the colors, the composition of the frame, it all just fit together so nicely. I was jealous that my work couldn’t come close to the stuff I was seeing. I was comparing my art, someone who seriously started learning just 2 weeks ago, to the art of someone who had been a professional in the industry or a serious hobbyist for years or even decades.

Many of us fall into this trap. We start comparing our work to that of people who have been practicing and perfecting their craft for years or even decades. This makes us feel inferior and many people quit because they feel like they’ll ‘never be as good as them’. Though it may be true that some beginners can produce work at a professional level out the gate, it is very rare. The way that I see it, a beginner has no right to be upset over a professional’s work. That professional has put in countless hours over their career to get to that point, while you’ve just begun your journey. It's almost insulting to them if you whine about not being as good when you haven’t worked as hard as them.

Now, I don’t say this to make you feel bad or to say that only certain people deserve to produce great work. Off course, if you start producing amazing work that is on-par with that of professionals, you should be very proud of yourself. However, most people won’t fall into that category. Most of you will start out very rough, producing work that is basic, and overall, not very good when compared to professionals, but that is ok. As a beginner, you are not expected to be a master. You are not expected to be the best and know everything. You need to lower your own expectations so that you can continue growing and not quit at the first sign of failure or mediocrity. Everyone started at zero, you don’t need to be ashamed of doing the same.

You need to set realistic standards for yourself, and understand that the only person you’re trying to be better than is your past self. Keeping this mindset will ensure you don’t get upset or demotivated when someone better comes along. Rather than being upset or jealous, learn from them, or at the very least, use them as inspiration to say “One day, I’ll be where they are”. Look up to the greats, but please understand that it will take time before you get to their level.

# Beware The Dip

Many people have an end goal in mind when learning something new. It could be being able to draw portraits if you’re learning to draw, or making a sweater if you’re learning to knit. What people don’t usually anticipate is the time it takes to get to a point where you’ve acquired enough of the skill to be able to do exactly what you want to the quality that you want.

During the start of your journey, you’ll be putting in a lot of hours, and getting proportionally better at the skill. The more effort you put in, the more you learn and grow. This is what YouTuber Mike Boyd calls “The Honeymoon Stage”. It’s where the amount of effort you invest into a skill will yield equal results. Eventually, a point will come where you’ll be putting in the same amount of effort, but you won’t feel as if you’re getting any better at the skill. You’ll feel as if you’re plateauing in your progress. This is called “The Dip”, a term coined by Seth Godin, author of the book by the same name. The dip is the valley in the learning curve where your efforts will have diminishing returns, and it is here that many people will likely quit because they feel like they’ve reached their limit and don’t have the aptitude required to acquire anymore of the skill.

I urge you to push those feelings of doubt out of your mind and continue learning. It’s very likely that you have what it takes to succeed, but at this point in your learning journey, you’re making the transition from a beginner to an intermediate skillset. This will take some time and a lot of effort to do, but once you’re out of the dip, that’s where the fun really begins. You will see that your ability to self-direct and complete projects will become much stronger, and you’ll be able to grasp and apply new concepts a lot faster. You will soon reach the moment where you’re able to pursue any personal or professional goals with relative ease, or at least you’ll have the courage to take them on even if they’re difficult because you have confidence in your skills.

# Hate It Till You Make It

Most people tend to forget that bigger things are usually built upon smaller ones. For example, if you want to learn how to draw portraits, you need to first learn how to draw basic shapes, how proportions work, shading principles, and many more core concepts. These smaller concepts will inevitably lead to the grand final stage where you’re able to comfortably and creatively make your own unique art. This principle is true for many things you want to learn.

Learning will require you to practice techniques and complete smaller projects you may find boring or that may seem like they aren’t directly tied to what you want to achieve. This can be quite off-putting because you’re spending time working on things you aren’t all that interested in and, once again, you may feel like quitting. The biggest tip I have for you to make this process a little more bearable is keep the final goal in mind every step of the way. You can do this in many ways depending on the skill you’re learning, but it is important to always keep some kind of inspirational reference to keep you going and see things from a birds-eye view when working on smaller pieces of the puzzle.

# Conclusion

So, there you go. As long as you keep these key things in the back of your mind as you dive into your learning journey, you won’t feel like a failure when you inevitably hit roadblocks. Understanding that these are things you will experience, and that most others will experience, will allow you to keep your head high and persevere on your path to mastering anything.
